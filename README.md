# Payload Composer

A client-side HTML payload composer for red team operations and security research. Embeds arbitrary binary files into self-contained HTML pages that trigger downloads via blob URLs — no server required.

## Features

- **4 Preset Templates** — Simple, Corporate Portal, Invoice, Software Installer
- **Custom Templates** — Upload or paste your own HTML with marker placeholders
- **3 Download Modes** — Auto (timer-triggered), Button (click-only), Both (auto + fallback button)
- **Obfuscation Layers** — Sliced base64, randomized element IDs, hidden SVG containers
- **Live Preview** — Iframe preview of generated output with source view and build log
- **Zero Dependencies** — Pure vanilla JS, no build step, no server, runs entirely in-browser

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yt2w/html-payload-smuggler.git
cd payload-composer
# Open index.html in any modern browser — that's it
```

Or serve locally:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
# → http://localhost:8080
```

## Usage

1. **Select a template** (preset or custom HTML)
2. **Drop a payload file** (any binary — .exe, .dll, .iso, .pdf, etc.)
3. **Configure download mode** — Auto, Button, or Both
4. **Click Compose** (or `Ctrl+Enter`)
5. **Download the composed HTML** or copy the source

The output is a single self-contained `.html` file. When opened by a target, it reconstructs the payload from embedded base64 slices and triggers a download via `createObjectURL`.

## Template Markers

Use these placeholders in custom HTML templates:

| Marker | Replaced With |
|--------|---------------|
| `{{DOWNLOAD_TRIGGER}}` | Download button element |
| `{{COUNTDOWN}}` | Countdown timer span |
| `{{SPINNER}}` | Loading spinner div |
| `{{PAYLOAD_NAME}}` | Configured output filename |

## Configuration Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Output filename | `document.iso` | What the downloaded file is named |
| Download mode | Auto | Auto / Button / Both |
| Auto-trigger delay | 2.5s | Seconds before auto-download fires |
| Countdown duration | 300s | Visible countdown timer (0 = disabled) |
| Slice size | 80 chars | Base64 chunk size per array element |
| Random ID length | 9 | Length of randomized element IDs |

## Technical Details

- Payload is base64-encoded and split into an array of string slices
- At runtime, slices are joined, decoded via `atob()`, and served as a Blob download
- Element IDs are randomized per composition to avoid signature matching
- No external requests — everything is inline in the output HTML
- Works offline after initial page load

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |

| `Ctrl+Enter` | Compose (when payload loaded) |
